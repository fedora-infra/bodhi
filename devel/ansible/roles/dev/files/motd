Welcome to the Bodhi development environment! Here are some helpful commands:

bdocs:      Build Bodhi's documentation.
blog:       View Bodhi's log.
brestart:   Restart the Bodhi service.
bstart:     Start the Bodhi service.
bstop:      Stop the Bodhi service.
btest:      Run Bodhi's test suite.
bteststyle: Run just the flake8 code style tests.


The BODHI_URL environment variable is set to http://localhost:6543 so the
bodhi client will use the local development server.

Happy hacking!
