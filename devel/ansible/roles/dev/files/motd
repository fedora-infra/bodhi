Welcome to the Bodhi development environment! Here are some helpful commands:

bci:         Run the same tests that CI runs locally (supports the same arguments as devel/run_tests.sh)
bdiff-cover: Run btest and then run diff-cover against the develop branch
bdocs:       Build Bodhi's documentation.
bfedmsg:     Display the log of Bodhi's fedmsgs.
blog:        View Bodhi's log. (Support all the systemctl options, such as -lf)
bresetdb:    Drop and reimport the database.
brestart:    Restart the Bodhi service.
bshell:      Get a handy python shell initialized with Bodhi models.
bstart:      Start the Bodhi service.
bstop:       Stop the Bodhi service.
btest:       Run Bodhi's test suite.
bteststyle:  Run just the flake8 code style tests.


The BODHI_URL environment variable is set to http://localhost:6543 so the
bodhi client will use the local development server.

Happy hacking!
