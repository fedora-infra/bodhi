bdocs:       Build Bodhi's documentation.
bfedmsg:     Display the log of Bodhi's messages on the bus.

bresetdb:    Drop and reimport the database.
brestart:    Restart the Bodhi service.

The BODHI_URL environment variable is set to http://localhost:6543 so the
bodhi client will use the local development server.

Happy hacking!
