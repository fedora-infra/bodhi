Welcome to the Bodhi development environment! Here are some helpful commands:

bdocs:       Build Bodhi's documentation.
blint:       Run a series of linter checks.
btest:       Run Bodhi's test suite (includes blint and bdocs).
bmessages:   Display the log of Bodhi's messages on the bus.
blog:        View Bodhi's log. (Support all the systemctl options, such as -lf).
bresetdb:    Drop and reimport the database.
brestart:    Restart the Bodhi service.
bodhi-shell: Get a handy python shell initialized with Bodhi models.
bstart:      Start the Bodhi service.
bstop:       Stop the Bodhi service.

The BODHI_URL and BODHI_OPENID_PROVIDER variables are set so the
the bodhi client will use the local development server and all
requests should work correctly.

You can run `systemctl start fm-consumer@remote.service` to run a
callback consumer that listens to real messages on the production
bus from Koji and ResultsDB, though this dev env may not be able
to correctly process all messages.

Happy hacking!
