v5.7.1
======
This is a bugfix release.

Server upgrade instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release contains database migrations. To apply them, run::

    $ sudo -u apache /usr/bin/alembic -c /etc/bodhi/alembic.ini upgrade head


Summary of the migrations:

* Add End of life (eol) field to the releases (:pr:`4241`).

Backwards incompatible changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Query on both relevant Greenwave decision contexts for critical-path updates.
  `Update.get_test_gating_info()` now returns a list of decision dictionaries,
  not a single decision dictionary. The API endpoint
  `/updates/{id}/get-test-results` similarly now returns a single-key
  dictionary whose value is a list of decisions, not a single decision
  dictionary. (:issue:`4259`).

Features
^^^^^^^^

* Added support for release names ending with "N" such as EPEL next
  (:pr:`4222`).
* Set a `delta` parameter of 30 days when quering datagrepper for bodhi-related
  user activity (:pr:`4255`).
* Added support for setting flags in generated advisories to require logging
  out and logging back in for the update to take effect (:issue:`4213`).
* Replace Greenwave decision change message consumer with ResultsDB and
  WaiverDB message consumers (:issue:`4230`).

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Fix an issue that caused the builds in a side-tag update to not be tagged
  correctly when the build list of the update was modified (:pr:`4161`).
* Bodhi will now delete the side-tag in Koji when an update is pushed to
  stable. Builds that were tagged in the side-tag but were not pushed as part
  of the update will be untagged. This is required to make sure to not leave
  stale side-tags in the Koji database (:pr:`4228`).
* Updates for archived releases cannot be edited anymore (:pr:`4236`).
* Correctly mark automatic updates as critpath when appropriate
  (:issue:`4177`).
* Fixed an issue with validators that prevents inconsistent refusal of bodhi
  override with maximum duration (:issue:`4182`).
* Fixed an issue where the search result box was cutted off out of screen
  borders (:issue:`4206`).
* Fixed a javascript bug which prevented the "waive tests" button to be
  displayed in UI (:issue:`4208`).
* Fixed an issue with validators that prevented a side-tag update owner to edit
  their update after adding a build for which they don't have commit access
  (:issue:`4209`).
* Avoid gating status ping-pong on update creation, assume status 'waiting' for
  2 hours or until first failed test (:issue:`4221`).
* For new packages submitted to repositories, the changelog was not generated
  and attached to the automatic Update. This prevented the bugs mentioned in
  the changelog to be closed by Bodhi (:issue:`4232`).
* Staging Bodhi now uses staging Bugzilla URL for bug links (:issue:`4238`).
* Fixed an issue where editing Updates always caused to set the request to
  Testing (:issue:`4263`).


Development improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Add End of life (eol) field to the releases (:issue:`4240`).

v5.7.0
======
This is a feature release.


Features
^^^^^^^^

* Query different Greenwave contexts for critical path updates, allowing for
  stricter policies to apply (:pr:`4180`).
* Use Pagure's `hascommit` new endpoint API to check user's rights to
  create/edit updates. This allow collaborators to push updates for releases
  for which they have commit access. (:pr:`4181`).

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Fixed an error about handling bugs in automatic updates (:pr:`4170`).
* Side-tag wheren't emptied when updates for current releases were pushed to
  stable (:pr:`4173`).
* Bodhi will avoid sending both 'update can now be pushed' and 'update has been
  pushed' notifications at the same time on updates pushed automatically
  (:issue:`3846`).
* Clear request status when release goes EOL (:issue:`4039`).
* Allow bodhi to not operate automatically on bugs linked to in changelog for
  specific releases (:issue:`4094`).
* Use the release git branch name to query PDC for critpath components
  (:issue:`4177`).
* Avoid using datetime.utcnow() for updateinfo <updated_date> and <issued_date>
  elements, use "date_submitted" instead. (:issue:`4189`).
* Updates which already had a comment that they can be pushed to stable were
  not automatically pushed to stable when the `stable_days` threshold was
  reached (:issue:`4042`).

Server upgrade instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release contains database migrations. To apply them, run::

    $ sudo -u apache /usr/bin/alembic -c /etc/bodhi/alembic.ini upgrade head


Features
^^^^^^^^

* Added a `from_side_tag` bool search parameter for Updates and allow searching
  for that and for gating status from WebUI (:pr:`4119`).
* Allow overriding `critpath.stable_after_days_without_negative_karma` based on
  release status (:pr:`4135`).
* Users which owns a side-tag can now create updates from that side-tag even if
  it contains builds for which they haven't commit access (:issue:`4014`).

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Fix encoding of package and user names in search results (:pr:`4104`).
* Fix autotime display on update page (:pr:`4110`).
* Set update.stable_days to 0 for Releases not composed by Bodhi itself
  (:pr:`4111`).

* Fixed a crash in automatic_updates handler due to trying access update.alias
  after the session was closed (:issue:`4147`).
* Some comments orphaned from their update where causing internal server
  errors. We now enforce a not null check so that a comment cannot be created
  without associating it to an update. The orphaned comments are removed from
  the database by the migration script. (:issue:`4155`).
* Dockerfile for pip CI tests has been fixed (:issue:`4158`).

Development improvements

v5.4.0
======
This is a minor release.


Server upgrade instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release contains database migrations. To apply them, run::

    $ sudo -u apache /usr/bin/alembic -c /etc/bodhi/alembic.ini upgrade head


Summary of the migrations:

* Migrate relationship between TestCase and Package to TestCase and Build. The migration script will take care of migrate existing data to the new relation.
* The user_id column in comments table has been set to be not nullable.
* The notes column in buildroot_overrides table has been converted to UnicodeText (from Unicode).

Bug fixes

* Associate TestCase to Build instead of Package, allowing to remove old
  testcases from updates (:issue:`1794`).

v5.3.0
======
This is a minor release.


Dependency changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Splitted handle_update task into two celery tasks for bugs and testcases.
  These two new tasks will make use of Celery's `autoretry_for` and
  `retry_backoff` features to circumvent external services connection problems.
  `retry_backoff` needs Celery >= 4.2 (:pr:`3989`).

Features
^^^^^^^^

* Associate bugs mentioned in rpm changelog to automatically created Rawhide
  updates; the bugs mentioned with the format `fix(es)|close(s)
  (fedora|epel|rh|rhbz)#BUG_ID` will be associated to the update and
  automatically closed (:issue:`3925`).

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Use jquery-typeahead for bodhi searchbar and always show the input field
  (:issue:`1455`).
* Reset update.date_testing when editing builds (:issue:`3493`).
* Removed pending_testing tag when self.request is still in
  UpdateRequest.testing (:issue:`3944`).
* Fix the broken privacy policy link for update's comment box. (:issue:`3971`).
* Do not bound the database session created using TransactionalSessionMaker
  class to the object created.
  Since threads are sharing the memory binding to the session object, it makes
  it possible for threads to
  override a previous session leading to unexpected behaviours.
  (:issue:`3979`).
* Editing builds in an update should not remove override tags (:issue:`3988`).
* Make Test Cases look clickable. (:issue:`4003`).
* If an update include no builds, use alias as title (:issue:`4012`).

Development improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Revise display for update's settings

  Showed a 'stable by karma: disabled' and a 'stable by time: disabled' in
  the UI when appropriate. Also added a 'Autotime: <Bool>' to the CLI output.
  (:issue:`3957`).
* Avoid using a database session in the tag_update_builds_task.
  (:issue:`3981`).
* Avoid using a database session in the handle side tag task. (:issue:`3983`).
* Ignore celery task's results we don't use. (:issue:`3995`).

Documentation improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Reference the state that happens when an update is revoked (:issue:`2902`).
* Document the full set of bug trackers that can be reference in Bodhi's
  markdown.
  Also added a section to Bodhi's Sphinx docs about Bodhi markdown,
  and listed the bug trackers there as well. (:issue:`3209`).

v5.2.2
======

v5.2.0
======
This is a feature and bugfix release.


Features
^^^^^^^^

* Added `__current__`, `__pending__` and `__archived__` macro filters to
  quickly filter Updates by Release status (:pr:`3892`).
* Added search filtering capabilities to the Overrides page (:pr:`3903`).
* Output the update install command into the bugs comments. Also change the
  `stable_bug_msg` and `testing_bug_msg` settings format to use placeholders in
  place of `%s`: if you have customized these settings you will need to adjust
  them to the new format. Here it is the list of the available placeholders:
  `{update_title}, {update_beauty_title}, {update_alias}, {repo},
  {install_instructions}, {update_url}` (:issue:`740`).
* Tag builds for updates asynchronously using Celery tasks. (:issue:`3061`).
* Add a Liveness and Readyness endpoints for OpenShift probes. (:issue:`3854`).
* Allow revoking the `push to stable` action (:issue:`3921`).

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Place 404 Not Found in the middle of the website (:pr:`3835`).
* RPM changelog was not automatically added in the notes for Rawhide updates as
  expected (:pr:`3931`).
* Add back the ability to add abitairy text as a build. (:issue:`3707`,
  :issue:`3765`).
* Allow to comment on update that were pushed to stable. (:issue:`3748`).
* Make comments submission to use common code with other forms and avoid
  clearing the spinner until the page refreshes (:issue:`3837`).
* Try to avoid timeout error when requesting latest_candidates with
  `hide_existing=true` (:issue:`3841`).
* Allow task id to be null in the bodhi.update.status.testing message schema.
  (:issue:`3852`).
* Sent UpdateReadyForTestingV1 only for rpm (:issue:`3855`).
* Prevent whitespaces string to be set as display name of an update
  (:issue:`3877`).
* Fixed pagination issue when using multiple values for the same filter
  (:issue:`3885`).
* Make sure we send the fedora-messaging messages before trigerring a celery
  task. (:issue:`3904`).
* Prevent updates from sidetags being stuck in Testing (:issue:`3912`).
* Do not allow to push back to testing a stable update (:issue:`3936`).

Development improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Use existing db session when creating a package: `Package.get_or_create()`
  now requires a session object in input (:pr:`3860`).
* Use koji's multicall in `tag_update_builds` task (:pr:`3958`).

Other changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Use Celery Beat instead of cron jobs. The corresponding CLIs have been
  adjusted
  to trigger the task. They will still block until the task is done, but it may
  not be running on the host that the CLI was called on. The affected CLIs are:
  ``bodhi-clean-old-composes``, ``bodhi-expire-overrides``,
  ``bodhi-approve-testing``, and ``bodhi-check-policies`` (:issue:`2867`).
