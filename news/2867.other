Use Celery Beat instead of cron jobs. The corresponding CLIs have been adjusted
to trigger the task. They will still block until the task is done, but it may
not be running on the host that the CLI was called on. The affected CLIs are:
``bodhi-clean-old-composes``, ``bodhi-expire-overrides``,
``bodhi-approve-testing``, and ``bodhi-check-policies``
