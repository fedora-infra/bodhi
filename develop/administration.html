<h2>System Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#system-requirements" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bodhi is currently only supported on active Fedora releases. It requires PostgreSQL &gt;= 9.2.0.</p>
</section>
<section id="configuration">
<h2>Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Bodhi server is configured via an INI file found at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/etc/bodhi/production.ini</span></code>. Bodhi ships
an example <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">production.ini</span></code> file that has all settings documented. Most settings have reasonable
defaults if not defined, and the example settings file describes the default values in the
commented settings. Here is a copy of the example config file with in-line documentation:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># The commented values in this config file represent the defaults.
#
# Note that under Python 3, you will need to use %% instead of % to put a literal % into the value
# of the config. Many settings use a %s for positional substitution, and those will need to be
# encoded as %%s.

# {release}_({version}_){request}_master_repomd: This is used by the composer to determine when a
#     primary architecture push has been synchronized to the master mirror for a given release and
#     request. The composer will verify that the checksum of repomd.xml at the master URL matches the
#     expected value, and will poll the URL until this test passes. Substitute release and request
#     for each release id (replacing -&#39;s with _&#39;s) and request (stable, testing). Used for the
#     arches listed in {release}_{version}_primary_arches when it is defined, else used for all
#     arches. You must put two %%s&#39;s in this setting - the first will be replaced with the release
#     version and the second will be replaced with the architecture.
# If a version of the option exists with a matching version, it has priority over one without.

#     request. The composer will verify that the checksum of repomd.xml at the master URL matches the
#     expected value, and will poll the URL until this test passes. Substitute release and request

## Primary architechures by release
##
## {release}_{version}_primary_arches: Releases that have alternative arches must define their
##      primary arches here. Any arches found during composing that are not present here are assumed
##      to be alternative arches. This is used during the wait_for_repo() step of the compose where
##      Bodhi polls the master repo to find out whether the compose has made it to the repo or not.
##      Bodhi looks for primary arches with the {release}_{request}_master_repomd setting above, and
##      for alternative arches at the {release}_{request}_alt_master_repomd setting above. If this
##      is not set, Bodhi will assume the release only has primary arches.

<h3>Logging<a class="headerlink" href="#logging" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The example configuration above includes an example default logging configuration. However, you may
wish to do something more advanced, such as e-mail error messages to an address with rate limiting.
Bodhi provides a rate limiting Python logging Filter at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">`bodhi.server.logging.RateLimiter`</span></code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is not possible to use Python logging filters with Pyramid’s ini file, so if you
wish to use Bodhi’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">`RateLimiter`</span></code> log filter, you will need to configure Pyramid to use
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/pyramid_sawing/">pyramid_sawing</a> so that it can use more advanced logging configuration. As a quick example, you
might put something like this into <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/etc/bodhi/production.ini</span></code> to configure Pyramid to use
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">`pyramid_sawing`</span></code> and to look for a logging config at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">`/etc/bodhi/logging.yaml`</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">pyramid</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">includes</span> <span class="o">=</span>
    <span class="n">pyramid_sawing</span>
<span class="n">pyramid_sawing</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">file</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">etc</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">bodhi</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">logging</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">yaml</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then you could configure all of you logging in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">`/etc/bodhi/logging.yaml`</span></code>. Here is a snippet you
could use in that file to get Bodhi to e-mail error logs, but to limit them to one e-mail per hour
per process per spot in the code that logs errors:</p>

<h4>Composer<a class="headerlink" href="#composer" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Bodhi has a process called the “composer” that is responsible for generating the repositories that
move packages along the path to their destiny. For each release, there are two composes that get
run, one for the release’s testing repository, and the other for the release’s stable repository.</p>
<p>Administrators can use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bodhi-push</span></code> tool to start composes. To view the status of composes
once they have been started, users can use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bodhi</span> <span class="pre">composes</span> <span class="pre">list</span></code> or they can visit the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/composes/</span></code> URL on the server. Composes can be in the following states:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>requested</strong>: The compose has been created by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bodhi-push</span></code>, but the composer has not yet
started working on the task.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>pending</strong>: The composer has received the task and will start it when it has free threads to do
so.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>initializing</strong>: The composer has started working on the task.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>updateinfo</strong>: The composer is generating the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">updateinfo.xml</span></code> file.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>punging</strong>: The composer is waiting for Pungi to finish creating the
repository.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>syncing_repo</strong>: The composer is polling the master mirror and waiting until the newly composed
repository is present there.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>notifying</strong>: The composer is sending out notifications about the updates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>success</strong>: The composer has successfully finished the task. This state does not last long as
the records of successful composes are deleted shortly after reaching this state.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>failed</strong>: The composer has failed. An administrator will usually have to inspect the error
message associated with the compose to determine what action to take to correct the problem, and
then the compose can be resumed with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bodhi-push</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>signing_repo</strong>: The composer is waiting on the repository to be signed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>cleaning</strong>: The composer is cleaning up old composes. This state only occurs if
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clean_old_composes</span></code> is set to True in the settings.</p></li>
