"""
Make appropriate changes to updates that reach certain karma or time-in-stable thresholds.

This script is intended to run as a regular job (cronjob or the like). It finds all updates in
UpdateStatus.testing with no request, then does one of three things. If the update does not meet
testing requirements (i.e. it doesn't have enough karma or time in testing to even be manually
pushed, or it fails gating checks), we do nothing. Otherwise, we set the date_approved
for the update if it's not already set, then choose one of the two other options.

If the update meets testing requirements, has autopush after a certain time in testing (autotime)
enabled, and has reached that threshold, we push it. Note this is the **ONLY** way updates
for releases "not composed by Bodhi" (Rawhide, ELN, Branched for the first few weeks) are ever
pushed stable. The other way updates can be autopushed stable - Update.check_karma_thresholds(),
called by Update.comment() - opts out of handling "not composed by Bodhi" release updates.

If the update meets testing requirements but does not have autotime enabled or has
not reached that threshold, we check to see if the update already has a comment saying it is
now "approved" for push to stable. If not, we post that comment, and publish the
UpdateRequirementsMetStableV1 message.

    Check requirements, update date_approved, then call appropriate handler function.

    In all cases, this will set date_approved if the update "meets testing requirements" -
    which means it has reached either the minimum karma or time threshold to be pushed
    stable, and its gating status is passed - and that date has not been set before.

    After that, if the update has automatic push for time enabled and has reached the required
    time threshold, this will call autopush_update to handle pushing it. It is intentional
    that we do not called approved_comment_message() in this case - there is no point alerting
    the maintainer that the update can be pushed manually if we are already going to push it
    automatically. See issue #3846.

    Otherwise - if the update is approved but is not being autopushed for time - this will
    call approved_comment_message() to post the approval comment and publish the
    UpdateRequirementsMetStable message, if it has not been done before.

    It has not yet proven necessary to check the karma autopush threshold here. For releases that
    are "composed by Bodhi", Update.check_karma_thresholds() pushes updates as soon as they
    reach the karma autopush threshold. For releases that are not "composed by Bodhi", on update
    creation, autotime is forced to True and the time threshold is forced to 0, thus updates for
    these releases are *always* eligible for autotime push here, as soon as they pass gating,
