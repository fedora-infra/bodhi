Welcome to bodhi's documentation!
=================================

Bodhi is designed to democratize the package update testing and release process for RPM based Linux
distributions. It provides an interface for developers to propose updates to a distribution, and an
interface for testers to leave feedback about updates through a +1/-1 karma system..
