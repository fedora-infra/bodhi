Testing updates
===============

Bodhi's primary use case is to gate proposed software updates based on testing feedback. Feedback
can be provided automatically by CI systems, or can be provided by humans through comments and
karma.


Karma
=====

Authenticated users may post positive or negative karma onto an update, along with a comment to
describe their experience. Once the update reaches its karma threshold (set by the packager), it may
be pushed out to the stable repositories. This will happen automatically if the update is configured
to use Bodhi's autokarma system, or manually by the packager if it is not.

Some updates are associated with Bugzilla tickets, and these updates will allow the tester to mark
whether they think the given bug is addressed by the update. Updates may also be linked to Wiki
documents that describe a testing plan for the associated packages, and the tester may provide
feedback for each of the wiki test pages as well.


Automated tests
===============

Bodhi may also provide feedback from automated test systems if it is configured to do so. To view
this feedback, click on the update's "Automated Tests" tab.

Bodhi may also be configured to query `Greenwave`_ for automated test based gating decisions on
updates. If this is enabled, the update's web page will display the current status of Greenwave's
gating decision.


Stable push
===========

An update can be pushed to stable repository either manually or automatically, through Bodhi's
`autotime` or `autokarma` features.

For becoming pushable to stable an update must fullfill some criteria set by the associated
release. Tipically, each release has a `mandatory_days_in_testing` and a `critpath_min_karma`
values that define the threshold after that the associated updates can be pushed to stable.
The `mandatory_days_in_testing` define the minimum amount of days each update must spend in
testing repository. The `critpath_min_karma` is the minimum karma that each update must reach.
An update can be manually pushed to stable by its submitter whatever threshold is reached first.
For example, if a release has a `critpath_min_karma` of +2, an update which reaches a +2 karma
**can be pushed to stable even if it hasn't reached the `mandatory_days_in_testing`**.

When submitting an update, the user can enable the `autotime` and the `autokarma` features and
set the related values `stable_days` and `stable_karma` for that specific update.
The `stable_days` value define the minimum amount of days each update must spend in
testing repository before the autopush is performed. It must be equal or greater than the release
`mandatory_days_in_testing`. The `stable_karma` is the minimum karma that each update must reach
before the autopush is performed. It must be equal or greater than the release `critpath_min_karma`.
For example, if a release has a `mandatory_days_in_testing` of 7, an update which has `autotime`
enabled and `stable_days` set to 10 will be pushable after 7 days **by manual action**, but the
autopush will be performed **after 3 more days**.
