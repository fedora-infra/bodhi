Synopsis

``bodhi`` COMMAND SUBCOMMAND [OPTIONS] [ARGS]...


Description
===========

``bodhi`` is the command line interface to bodhi, Fedora's update release management system. It can
be used to create or modify updates and overrides.


Options
=======

Most of the commands will accept these options:

``--debug``

    Some commands accept this flag to show extra debug information.

``--help``

    Show help text and exit.

``--password <text>``

    A password to authenticate as the user given by ``--user``.

``--staging``

    Use the staging bodhi instance instead of the production instance.

``--url <url>``

    Use the Bodhi server at the given URL instead of the default server. This can also be set with
    the ``BODHI_URL`` environment variable. This is ignored if the ``--staging`` flag is set.

``--user <username>``

    Many commands accept this flag to specify a Fedora username to authenticate with. Note that some
    read operations such as querying updates and overrides use this same flag, but as a search
    parameter instead of authentication (as authentication is not required for these operations).

``--version``

    Show version and exit. Not accepted by subcommands.
