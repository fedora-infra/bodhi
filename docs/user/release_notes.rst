Config change
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default value for ``greenwave_api_url`` was changed from
``https://greenwave.fedoraproject.org/api/v1.0`` to
``https://greenwave-web-greenwave.app.os.fedoraproject.org/api/v1.0`` as the old value was a
non-extant domain.


Dependency changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Bodhi now requires ``cornice>=3``.
* Bodhi now formally documents that it requires PostgreSQL >= 9.2.0 in :doc:`../administration`.


v3.1.0
------

Special instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The Alembic configuration file has changed to use the Python path of the migrations.
  In order to run the new migrations, you should ensure your alembic.ini has
  ``script_location = bodhi:server/migrations``.


Dependency changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The client formally depends on ``iniparse`` now. It needed this before but the dependency was
  undocumented (:commit:`ddf47eb2`).
* Bodhi no longer uses or requires ``webhelpers``. RSS feeds are now generated by ``feedgen``, a new
  required dependency.
* Bodhi no longer uses or requires ``bunch``.


Features
^^^^^^^^

* The CLI now prints a helpful hint about how to use ``koji wait-repo`` when creating or editing a
  buildroot override, or when a query for overrides returns exactly one result (:issue:`1376`).
* Bodhi now uses connection pooling when making API requests to other services (:issue:`1753`).
* The bindings now conditionally import ``dnf`` (:issue:`1812`).
* It is now possible to query for Releases by a list of primary keys, by using the querystring
  ``ids`` with the ``releases/`` API.
* Builds now serialize their ``release_id`` field.
* It is now possible to configure a maximum number of mash threads that Bodhi will run at once,
  which is handy if the new Pungi masher has been mean to your NAS. There is a new
  ``max_concurrent_mashes`` setting in production.ini, which defaults to ``2``.
* There is now a man page for :doc:`man_pages/bodhi-clean-old-mashes`.
* The documentation was reorganized by type of reader (:commit:`14e81a81`).
* The documentation now uses the Alabaster theme (:commit:`f15351e2`).
* The CLI now has a ``--arch`` flag that can be used when downloading updates to specify which
  architecture is desired (:commit:`6538c9e9`).
* Bodhi's documentation now includes an :doc:`../administration` section which includes
  documentation on its various settings (:commit:`310f56d4`).


Bugs
^^^^

* Bodhi now uses the correct comment on critical path updates regarding how many days are required
  in testing (:issue:`1361`).
* All home page update types now have mouseover titles (:issue:`1620`).
* e-mail subjects again include the version of the updates (:issue:`1635`).
* The bindings will re-attempt authentication upon captcha failures (:issue:`1787`).
* The formatting is fixed on mobile for the edit/create update form (:issue:`1791`).
* The "Push to Stable" button is now rendered in the web UI on batched updates (:issue:`1907`).
* Do not fail the mash if a changelog is malformed (:issue:`1989`).
* :doc:`man_pages/bodhi-dequeue-stable` no longer dies if it encounters updates that can't be pushed
  stable (:issue:`2004`).
* Unreachable RSS Accept-header based redirects were fixed (:commit:`6f3db0c0`).
* Fixed an unsafe default in ``bodhi.server.util.call_api()`` (:commit:`9461b3a4`).
* Bodhi now distinguishes between testing and stable when asking Greenwave for gating decisions
  (:commit:`6d907a7a`).
* The CLI now renders the correct URL for updates without aliases (:commit:`caaa0e6e`).


Development improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The database migrations are now shipped as part of the Python distribution
  (`#1777 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/pull/1777>`_).
* The developer docs pertaining to using virtualenvs have been corrected and improved
  (:issue:`1797`).
* The ``test_utils.py`` tests now use the ``BaseTestCase``, which allows them to pass when run by
  themselves (:issue:`1817`).
* An obsolete mash check for symlinks was removed (:issue:`1819`).
* A mock was moved inside of a test to avoid inter-test dependencies (:issue:`1848`).
* Bodhi is now compliant with ``flake8``'s ``E722`` check (:issue:`1927`).
* The JJB YAML file is now tested to ensure it is valid YAML (:issue:`1934`).
* Some code has been prepared for Python 3 compatibility (:commit:`d7763560`).
* Developers are now required to sign the `DCO`_ (:commit:`34d0ceb0`).
* There is now formal documentation on how to submit patches to Bodhi (:commit:`bb20a0ee`).
* Bodhi is now tested by Fedora containers in the CentOS CI environment (:commit:`36d603f0`).
* Bodhi is now tested against dependencies from PyPI (:commit:`1e8fb65d`).
* The ``development.ini.example`` file has been reduced to a minimal form, which means we no longer
  need to document the settings in two places (:commit:`2b7dc4e5`).
* Bodhi now runs CI tests for different PRs in parallel (:commit:`6427309f`).
* ``Vagrantfile.example`` has been moved to ``devel/`` for tidiness (:commit:`21ff2e58`).
* It is now easier to replicate the CI environment locally by using the ``devel/run_tests.sh``
  script.
* Many more docblocks have been written across the codebase.
* Line test coverage is now at 93%.

3.0.0
-----

Backwards incompatible changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Support for the ``USERNAME`` environment variable in all of Bodhi's CLI tools has been dropped, as
  it conflicts with GDM's variable by the same name. Many users do not have the same FAS username as
  they use on their desktop, and this variable causes confusion in the CLI
  (`#1789 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1789>`_).
* The layout of the repositories after mash is now different.
* The following settings have been removed from Bodhi, as Pungi now manages
  comps files instead of Bodhi::

    * ``compose_atomic_trees``
    * ``comps_dir``
    * ``comps_url``
    * ``mash_conf``

* ``bodhi-push`` no longer has a ``--staging`` flag as it was not needed. It was used to determine
  the mashing directory to look for lock files, but the directories it looked in were hardcoded
  instead of using the ``mash_dir`` setting. With 3.0.0, ``mash_dir`` is used and the ``--staging``
  flag is no longer needed.


Dependency changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Bodhi no longer uses or requires mash.
* Bodhi no longer uses or requires fedmsg-atomic-composer.
* Pungi is now a required dependency for Bodhi, replacing mash.
* jinja2 is now a required dependency for Bodhi, used by its masher.


New settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``production.ini`` file supports some new settings:

* ``pungi.basepath`` specifies which path Bodhi should find Pungi config files inside. Defaults to
  ``/etc/bodhi``.
* ``pungi.cmd`` specifies the command to run ``pungi`` with. Defaults to ``/usr/bin/pungi-koji``.
* ``pungi.conf.module`` should be the name of a jinja2 template file found in ``pungi.basepath``
  that will be rendered to generate a Pungi config file that will be used to mash RPM repositories
  (yum, dnf, and atomic repositories). Defaults to ``pungi.module.conf``, meaning that an
  ``/etc/bodhi/pungi.module.conf`` is the default config file for Modules.
* ``pungi.conf.rpm`` should be the name of a jinja2 template file found in ``pungi.basepath`` that
  will be rendered to generate a Pungi config file that will be used to mash RPM repositories (yum,
  dnf, and atomic repositories). Defaults to ``pungi.rpm.conf``, meaning that an
  ``/etc/bodhi/pungi.rpm.conf`` is the default config file for RPMs.
* The ``pungi.conf.*`` setting files above have the following jinja2 template variables available to
  them::

    * 'id': The id of the Release being mashed.
    * 'release': The Release being mashed.
    * 'request': The request being mashed.
    * 'updates': The Updates being mashed.

You will need to create ``variants.xml`` templates inside ``pungi.basepath`` as well. These
templates will have access to the same template variables described above, and should be named
``variants.rpm.xml.j2`` and ``variants.module.xml.j2``, for RPM composes and module composes,
respectively.


Features
^^^^^^^^

The 3.0.0 release is focused on delivering one big change that enables a variety of features: the
use of Pungi to do mashing rather than mash. The most notable feature this enables is the ability to
deliver update repositories for modules, but in general all of Pungi's feature set is now available
for Bodhi to use.

* Bodhi now supports non-RPM artifacts, namely, modules
  (`#653 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/653>`_,
  `#1330 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1330>`_).
* Via Pungi, Bodhi is now able to use Koji signed repos
  (`#909 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/909>`_).
* Via Pungi, Bodhi is now able to generate OSTrees that are more consistent with Fedora's release
  day OSTrees
  (`#1182 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1182>`_).
* Bodhi now uses Pungi instead of the retiring mash project
  (`#1219 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1219>`_).


Bugs
^^^^

* Bodhi, via Pungi, will now reliably produce repomd files
  (`#887 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/887>`_).
* Bodhi's CLI no longer uses USERNAME, which conflicted with GDM for users who use a different local
  system username than their FAS username. For such users, there was no workaround other than to
  constantly use the ``--user`` flag, and the environment varaible wasn't particularly useful
  anymore now that the Bodhi CLI remembers usernames after one successful authentication
  (`#1789 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1789>`_).

* There is now a timeout on fetching results from ResultsDB in the backend
  (`#1597 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1597>`_).
* Critical path updates now have positive days_to_stable and will only comment about pushing to

2.10.0
------

Compatibility changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release of Bodhi has a few changes that are technically backward incompatible in some senses,
but it was determined that each of these changes are justified without raising Bodhi's major
version, often due to features not working at all or being unused. Justifications for each are given
inline.

* dnf and iniparse are now required dependencies for the Python bindings. Justification:
  Technically, these were needed before for some of the functionality, and the bindings would
  traceback if that functionality was used without these dependencies being present. With this
  change, the module will fail to import without them, and they are now formal dependencies.
* Support for EL 5 has been removed in this release. Justification: EL 5 has become end of life.
* The pkgtags feature has been removed. Justification: It did not work correctly and enabling it was
  devastating
  (`#1634 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1634>`_).
* Some bindings code that could log into Koji with TLS certificates was removed. Justification: It
  was unused
  (`b4474676 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/commit/b4474676>`_).
* Bodhi's short-lived ``ci_gating`` feature has been removed, in favor of the new
  Greenwave integration feature. Thus, the ``ci.required`` and ``ci.url`` settings no longer
  function in Bodhi. The ``bodhi-babysit-ci`` utility has also been removed. Justification: The
  feature was never completed and thus no functionality is lost
  (`#1733 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/pull/1733>`_).


Features
^^^^^^^^

* There are new search endpoints in the REST API that perform ilike queries to support case
  insensitive searching. Bodhi's web interface now uses these endpoints
  (`#997 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/997>`_).
* It is now possible to search by update alias in the web interface
  (`#1258 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1258>`_).
* Exact matches are now sorted first in search results
  (`#692 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/692>`_).
* The CLI now has a ``--mine`` flag when searching for updates or overrides
  (`#811 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/811>`_,
  `#1382 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1382>`_).
* The CLI now has more search parameters when querying overrides
  (`#1679 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1679>`_).
* The new case insensitive search is also used when hitting enter in the search box in the web UI
  (`#870 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/870>`_).
* Bodhi is now able to query Pagure for FAS groups for ACL info
  (`f9414601 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/commit/f9414601>`_).
* The Python bindings' ``candidates()`` method now automatically intiializes the username
  (`6e8679b6 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/commit/6e8679b6>`_).
* CLI errors are now printed in red text
  (`431b9078 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/commit/431b9078>`_).
* The graphs on the metrics page now have mouse hovers to indicate numerical values
  (`#209 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/209>`_).
* Bodhi now has support for using `Greenwave <https://pagure.io/greenwave/>`_ to gate updates based
  on test results. See the new ``test_gating.required``, ``test_gating.url``, and
  ``greenwave_api_url`` settings in ``production.ini`` for details on how to enable it. Note also
  that this feature introduces a new server CLI tool, ``bodhi-check-policies``, which is intended to
  be run via cron on a regular interval. This CLI tool communicates with Greenwave to determine if
  updates are passing required tests or not
  (`#1733 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/pull/1733>`_).


Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* The autokarma check box's value now persists when editing updates
  (`#1692 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1692>`_,
  `#1482 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1482>`_, and
  `#1308 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1308>`_).
* The CLI now catches a variety of Exceptions and prints user readable errors instead of tracebacks
  (`#1126 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1126>`_,
  `#1626 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1626>`_).
* The Python bindings' ``get_releases()`` method now uses a GET request
  (`#784 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/784>`_).
* The HTML sanitization code has been refactored, which fixed a couple of issues where Bodhi didn't
  correctly escape things like e-mail addresses
  (`#1656 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1656>`_,
  `#1721 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1721>`_).
* The bindings' docstring for the ``comment()`` method was corrected to state that the ``email``
  parameter is used to make anonymous comments, rather than to enable or disable sending of e-mails
  (`#289 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/289>`_).
* The web interface now links directly to libravatar's login page instead of POSTing to it
  (`#1674 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1674>`_).
* The new/edit update form in the web interface now works with the new typeahead library
  (`#1731 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1731>`_).


Development improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Several more modules have been documented with PEP-257 compliant docblocks.
* Several new tests have been added to cover various portions of the code base, and Bodhi now has
  89% line test coverage. The goal is to reach 100% line coverage within the next 12 months, and
  then begin to work towards 100% branch coverage.

2.9.0
-----

Features
^^^^^^^^

* It is now possible to set required Taskotron tests with the ``--requirements`` CLI flag
  (`#1319 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1319>`_).
* The CLI now has tab completion in bash
  (`#1188 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1188>`_).
* Updates that are pending testing now go straight to stable if they reach required karma
  (`#632 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/632>`_).
* The automated tests tab now shows a count on info results
  (`1de12f6a <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/commit/1de12f6a>`_).
* The UI now displays a spinner while a search is in progress
  (`#436 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/436>`_).
* It is now possible to middle click on search results in the web UI
  (`#461 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/461>`_).
* Pending releases are now displayed on the home page
  (`#1619 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1619>`_).
* Links without an explicit scheme can now be detected as links
  (`#1721 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1721>`_).


Bugs
^^^^

* Wiki test cases are no longer duplicated
  (`#780 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/780>`_).
* The server bodhi-manage-releases script now uses the new Bodhi bindings
  (`#1338 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1338>`_).
* The server bodhi-manage-releases script now supports the ``--url`` flag
  (`0181a344 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/commit/0181a344>`_).
* The ``--help`` output from the Bodhi CLI is cleaner and more informative
  (`#1457 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1457>`_).
* The CLI now provides more informative error messages when creating duplicate overrides
  (`#1377 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1377>`_).
* E-mail subjects now include build versions again
  (`#1635 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1635>`_).
* Taskotron results with the same scenario key are now all displayed
  (`d5b0bfa3 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/commit/d5b0bfa3>`_).
* The front page UI elements now line up
  (`#1659 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1659>`_).
* The UI now properly urlencodes search URLs to properly escape characters such as "+"
  (`#1015 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1015>`_).
* e-mail addresses are now properly processed by the markdown system
  (`#1656 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1656>`_).


Development improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The bundled typeahead JavaScript library is rebased to version 1.1.1 from the maintained
  fork at https://github.com/corejavascript/typeahead.js . The main typeahead repo
  appears to be unmaintained and contained a bug that we were hitting:
  https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js/issues/1381
* Docblocks were written for several more modules.
* Bodhi now hard depends on rpm instead of conditionally importing it
  (`#1166 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1166>`_).
* Bodhi now has CI provided by CentOS that is able to test pull requests. Thanks to Brian Stinson
  and CentOS for providing this service to the Bodhi project!
* Some ground work has been done in order to enable batched updates, so that medium and low priority
  updates can be pushed on a less frequent interval than high priority (security or urgent) updates.
* Bodhi now uses py.test as the test runner instead of nose.
* Tox is now used to run the style tests.
* There is now a unified test base class that creates a single TestApp for the tests to use. The
  TestApp was the source of a significant memory leak in Bodhi's tests. As a result of this
  refactor, Bodhi's tests now consume about 450 MB instead of about 4.5 GB. As a result, the example
  Vagrantfile now uses 2 GB of RAM instead of 5 GB. It is likely possible to squeeze it down to 1 GB
  or so, if desired.
* Bodhi now supports both the bleach 1 and bleach 2 APIs
  (`#1718 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1718>`_).

2.8.1
-----

Bugs
^^^^

* Restore defaults for three settings back to the values they had in Bodhi 2.7.0 (
  `#1633 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/pull/1633>`_,
  `#1640 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/pull/1640>`_, and

Release contributors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following contributors submitted patches for Bodhi 2.8.1:

* Patrick Uiterwijk (the true 2.8.1 hero)
* Randy Barlow


2.8.0
-----

Special instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* There is a new setting, ``ci.required`` that defaults to False. If you wish to use CI, you must
  add a cron task to call the new ``bodhi-babysit-ci`` CLI periodically.


Deprecation
^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``/search/packages`` API call has been deprecated.


New Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Bodhi now uses Bleach to sanitize markdown input from the user.
  python-bleach 1.x is a new dependency in this release of Bodhi.


Features
^^^^^^^^

* The API, fedmsg messages, bindings, and CLI now support non-RPM content (
  `#1325 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1325>`_,
  `#1326 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1326>`_,
  `#1327 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1327>`_, and
  `#1328 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1328>`_).
  Bodhi now knows about Fedora's new module format, and is able to handle everything they need
  except publishing (which will appear in a later release). This release is also the first Bodhi
  release that is able to handle multiple content types.
* Improved OpenQA support in the web UI
  (`#1471 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1471>`_).
* The type icons are now aligned in the web UI
  (`4b6b7597 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/commit/4b6b7597>`_ and
  `d0940323 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/commit/d0940323>`_).
* There is now a man page for ``bodhi-approve-testing``
  (`cf8d897f <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/commit/cf8d897f>`_).
* Bodhi can now automatically detect whether to use DDL table locks if BDR is present during
  migrations (`059b5ab7 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/commit/059b5ab7>`_).
* Locked updates now grey out the edit buttons with a tooltip to make the lock more obvious to the
  user (`#1492 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1492>`_).
* Users can now do multi-line literal code blocks in comments
  (`#1509 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1509>`_).

  possible to comment most of Bodhi's settings file and achieve sane defaults. Some settings are
  still required, see the default ``production.ini`` file for documentation of all settings and
  their defaults. A few unused settings were removed
  (`#1488 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1488>`_,
  `#1489 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1489>`_, and
  `263b7b7f <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/commit/263b7b7f>`_).
* The web UI now displays the content type of the update
  (`#1329 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1329>`_).
* Bodhi now has a new ``ci.required`` setting that defaults to False. If enabled. updates will gate
  based on Continuous Integration test results and will not proceed to updates-testing unless the
  tests pass
  (`0fcb73f8 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/commit/0fcb73f8>`_).
* Update builds are now sorted by NVR
  (`#1441 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1441>`_).
* The backend code is reworked to allow gating on resultsdb data and requirement validation
  performance is improved
  (`#1550 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1550>`_).
* Bodhi is now able to map distgit commits to Builds, which helps map CI results to Builds. There is
  a new ``bodhi-babysit-ci`` CLI that must be run periodically in cron if ``ci.required`` is
  ``True``
  (`ae01e5d1 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/commit/ae01e5d1>`_).

2.6.0
-----

Special instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. The database migrations have been trimmed in this release. To upgrade to this version of Bodhi
   from a version prior to 2.3, first upgrade to Bodhi 2.3, 2.4, or 2.5, run the database
   migrations, and then upgrade to this release.
#. Bodhi cookies now expire, but cookies created before 2.6.0 will not automatically expire. To
   expire all existing cookies so that only expiring tickets exist, you will need to change
   ``authtkt.secret`` to a new value in your settings file.


Dependency adjustments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* zope.sqlalchemy is no longer a required dependency
  (`#1414 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/pull/1414>`_).
* WebOb is no longer a directly required dependency, though it is still indirectly required through
  pyramid.


Features
^^^^^^^^

* The web UI footer has been restyled to fit better with the new theme
  (`#1366 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/pull/1366>`_).
* A link to documentation has been added to the web UI footer
  (`#1321 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1321>`_).
* The bodhi CLI now supports editing updates
  (`#937 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/937>`_).
* The CLI's ``USERNAME`` environment variable is now documented, and its ``--user`` flag is
  clarified (`28dd380a <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/commit/28dd380a>`_).
* The icons that we introduced in the new theme previously didn't have titles.
  Consequently, a user might not have know what these icons meant. Now if a user
  hovers over these icons, they get a description of what they mean, for
  example: "This is a bugfix update" or "This update is in the critial path"
  (`#1362 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1362>`_).
* Update pages with lots of updates look cleaner
  (`#1351 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1351>`_).
* Update page titles are shorter now for large updates
  (`#957 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/957>`_).
* Add support for alternate architectures to the MasherThread.wait_for_sync()
  (`#1343 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1343>`_).
* Update lists now also include type icons next to the updates
  (`5983d99c <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/commit/5983d99c>`_).
* Testing updates use a consistent label color now
  (`62330644 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/commit/62330644>`_).
* openQA results are now displayed in the web ui
  (`450dbafe <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/commit/450dbafe>`_).
* Bodhi cookies now expire. There is a new ``authtkt.timeout`` setting that sets Bodhi's session
  lifetime, defaulting to 1 day.


Bugs
^^^^

* Comments that don't carry karma don't count as a user's karma vote
  (`#829 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/829>`_).
* The web UI now uses the update alias instead of the title so editors of large updates can click
  the edit button (`#1161 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1161>`_).
* Initialize the bugtracker in ``main()`` instead of on import so that docs can be built without
  installing Bodhi (`#1359 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/pull/1359>`_).
* Make the release graph easier to read when there are many datapoints
  (`#1172 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1172>`_).
* Optimize the JavaScript that loads automated test results from ResultsDB
  (`#983 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/983>`_).

  (`#1310 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1310>`_).
* ``pop`` and ``copy`` now lazily load the configuration
  (`#1423 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1423>`_).


Development improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* A new automated PEP-257 test has been introduced to enforce docblocks across the codebase.
  Converting the code will take some time, but the code will be expanded to fully support PEP-257
  eventually. A few modules have now been documented.
* Test coverage is now 84%.
* The Vagrant environment now has vim with a simple vim config to make sure spaces are used instead
  of tabs (`#1372 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/pull/1372>`_).
* The Package database model has been converted into a single-table inheritance model, which will
  aid in adding multi-type support to Bodhi. A new RpmPackage model has been added.
  (`#1392 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/pull/1392>`_).
* The database initialization code is unified
  (`e9a26042 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/commit/e9a26042>`_).
* The base model class now has a helpful query property
  (`8167f262 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/commit/8167f262>`_).
* .pyc files are now removed when running the tests in the dev environment
  (`9e9adb61 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/commit/9e9adb61>`_).
* An unused inherited column has been dropped from the builds table
  (`e8a95b12 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/commit/e8a95b12>`_).

^^^^
* The position of the Add Comment button is now the bottom right.
  (`#902 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/902>`_).
* An unusuable ``--request`` flag has been removed from a CLI command
  (`#1187 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1187>`_).
* The cursor is now a pointer when hovering over Releases button
  (`#1296 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1296>`_).
* The number of days to stable is now correctly calculated on updates

2.4.0
-----

Bodhi 2.4.0 is a feature and bugfix release.


Features
^^^^^^^^
* The web interface now displays whether an update has autopush enabled
  (`#999 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/999>`_).
* Autopush is now disabled on any update that receives authenticated negative karma
  (`#1191 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1191>`_).
* Bodhi now links to Koji builds via TLS instead of plaintext
  (`#1246 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1246>`_).
* Some usage examples have been added to the ``bodhi`` man page.
* Bodhi's server package has a new script called ``bodhi-clean-old-mashes`` that can recursively
  delete any folders with names that end in a dash followed by a string that can be interpreted as a
  float, sparing the newest 10 by lexigraphical sorting. This should help release engineers keep the
  Koji mashing folder clean.

  Python bindings to Bodhi's REST API.
* The ``bodhi`` CLI now prints autokarma and thresholds when displaying updates.

* Bodhi's signed handler now skips builds that were not assigned to a release.
* The comps file is now cloned into an explicit path during mashing.
* The buildsystem is now locked during login.


Development improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* A great deal of tests were written for Bodhi. Test coverage is now up to 81% and is enforced by
  the test suite.
* Bodhi's server code is now PEP-8 compliant.
* The docs now contain contribution guidelines.
* The build system will now fail with a useful Exception if used without being set up.

2.3.1
-----

Bodhi 2.3.1 fixes `#1067 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/1067>`_,
such that edited updates now tag new builds into the ``pending_signing_tag``
instead of the ``pending_testing_tag``. This is needed for automatic signing
gating to work.
