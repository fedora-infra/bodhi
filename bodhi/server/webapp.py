"""
Define Bodhi's WSGI application.

As of the writing of this docblock, this module is a bit misnamed since the webapp is actually
defined in bodhi.server.__init__. However, that is an anti-pattern with lots of nasty in-line
imports due to circular dependencies, and this module is intended to solve that problem.
Unfortunately, it is a backwards-incompatible change to move main() here, so it will remain in
__init__ until we make a major Bodhi release. See https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/2294

    Prepare each incoming request to Bodhi.

    This function does two things:
        * If requests do not have an Accept header, or if their Accept header is "*/*", it sets the
          header to application/json. Pyramid has undefined behavior when an ambiguous or missing
          Accept header is received, and multiple views are defined that handle specific Accept
          headers. For example, we have a view that returns html or JSON for /composes/, depending
          on the Accept header, but if a request has no Accept header or has */*, Pyramid will
          consider both views to be a match for the request and so it is undefined which view will
          handle the request. Let's force ambibuous requests to receive a JSON response so we have a
          defined behavior. See https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/issues/2731.
