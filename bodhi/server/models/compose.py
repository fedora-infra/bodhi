    Express the status of an in-progress compose job.

    This object is used in a few ways:

        * It ensures that only one compose process runs per repo, serving as a compose "lock".
        * It marks which updates are part of a compose, serving as an update "lock".
        * It gives the compose process a place to log which step it is in, which will allow us to
          provide compose monitoring tools.

    Attributes:
        __exclude_columns__ (tuple): A tuple of columns to exclude when __json__() is called.
        __include_extras__ (tuple): A tuple of attributes to add when __json__() is called.
        __tablename__ (str): The name of the table in the database.
        checkpoints (str): A JSON serialized object describing the checkpoints the composer has
            reached.
        date_created (datetime.datetime): The time this Compose was created.
        error_message (str): An error message indicating what happened if the Compose failed.
        id (None): We don't want the superclass's primary key since we will use a natural primary
            key for this model.
        release_id (int): The primary key of the :class:`Release` that is being composed. Forms half
            of the primary key, with the other half being the ``request``.
        request (UpdateRequest): The request of the release that is being composed. Forms half of
            the primary key, with the other half being the ``release_id``.
        release (Release): The release that is being composed.
        state_date (datetime.datetime): The time of the most recent change to the state attribute.
        state (ComposeState): The state of the compose.
        updates (sqlalchemy.orm.collections.InstrumentedList): An iterable of updates included in
            this compose.
