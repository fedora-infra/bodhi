    """
    This model represents a Koji buildroot override.

    A buildroot override is a way to add a build to the Koji buildroot (the set of packages used
    to build a package) manually. Normally, builds are only available after they are pushed to
    "stable", but this allows a build to be added to the buildroot immediately. This is useful
    for updates that depend on each other to be built.

    Attributes:
        notes (str): A text field that holds arbitrary notes about the buildroot override.
        submission_date (DateTime): The date that the buildroot override was submitted.
        expiration_date (DateTime): The date that the buildroot override expires.
        expired_date (DateTime): The date that the buildroot override expired.
        build_id (int): The primary key of the :class:`Build` this override is related to.
        build (Build): The build this override is related to.
        submitter_id (int): The primary key of the :class:`User` this override was created by.
        submitter (User): The user this override was created by.
