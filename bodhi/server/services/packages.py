        like: Search for Packages with names like the given string.
        search: Search for Packages with names like the given string, with case insensitivity.
        page: Retrieve the specified page of search results.
        rows_per_page: Specify how many rows per page are desired.

        request (pyramid.request): The current web request.

            page: The current page of results.
