"""
The "updates handler".

This module is responsible for doing value-added work "offline" that used to be
done when updates were submitted.  Specifically, when someone submits an update
we used to:

- Update any bugs in bugzilla associated with the update.
- Check for test cases in the wiki.

Those things could sometimes take a *very* long time, especially if there were
lots of builds and lots of bugs in the update.

Now, update-submission breezes by those steps and simply tells the user "OK".
A message gets published when their update goes through, and *that* message
gets received here and triggers us to do all that network-laden heavy lifting.
