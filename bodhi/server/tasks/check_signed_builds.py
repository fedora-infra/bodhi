"""
Avoid Updates being stuck in pending.

It may happen that Bodhi misses fedora-messaging messages announcing builds
have been signed.
In these cases, the Update remain stuck in pending until a manual intervention.

This script will cycle through builds of Updates in pending status and update
the signed status in the db to match the tags found in Koji.
