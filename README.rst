IRC

Come join us on `Freenode <https://webchat.freenode.net/>`_! We've got two channels:

* #bodhi - We use this channel to discuss upstream bodhi development
* #fedora-apps - We use this channel to discuss Fedora's Bodhi deployment (it is more generally
  about all of Fedora's infrastructure applications.)
